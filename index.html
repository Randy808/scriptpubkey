      <h1>Bitcoin's homegrown programming language</h1>
      <p>
        Bitcoin script is a programming language developed by Satoshi Nakamoto
        for the purpose of programatically declaring the conditions in which
        Bitcoin can be spent. Bitcoin script is a core component of the Bitcoin
        protocol and can be found in the source code of any protocol-compliant
        Bitcoin node software. Script was created as part of the first public
        implementation of the Bitcoin software released in 2008 and continues to
        be a vital part of the codebase today. The necessity for script came
        about when Satoshi acknowledged and tackled one of the limitations of
        developing a consensus protocol -- slow adoption to change. Thus, the
        long-term functionality of Bitcoin would be dependent on the design
        decisions of the initial protocol implementation.

          >Following this thought process, 'script' was made to act as a robust
          way to specify the spending condition of coins and not limit how a
          user specifies who can spend their coins.</a

        Bitcoin script is a stack-based programming language with no loops,
        therefore excluding it from membership in the turing-complete group of
        programming languages. A
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parser</a> was
        <a
          href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898/script.cpp#L44"
          >built into Bitcoin's first implementation</a
        >
        to support the evaluation of this language and now has its specification
        as part of the consensus protocol. Because Bitcoin script is used to
        specify the spending conditions of individual amounts of Bitcoin, it is
        stored on the blockchain as part of every transaction spending Bitcoin.
        Bitcoin script's usage is unavoidable and at a high level, Bitcoin
        cannot be sent to another individual without it. Although the
        development of Bitcoin script was used to support the more complex
        use-cases of payment Satoshi mentioned in the early days ("Escrow
        transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party
        signature, etc."), most transactions follow the same structure of just
        attempting to send money to a particular address.

        Today the Bitcoin script language is primarily maintained by the open
        source contributors to the Bitcoin core codebase, and changes to the
        script are proposed as rfc-like documents called Bitcoin improvement
        proposals (BIPs). The high-level Bitcoin script specification consists
        of operations in the format of OP\_{command} with each operation/keyword
        mapping to an unsigned integer. The parser for the language within the
        Bitcoin core codebase reads the operation-mapped integers as hex for
        it's input while the name for the operations aren't used in the script
        code itself over concern for the size of these transactions. Changes are
        typically proposed to the Bitcoin script language when new functionality
        is desired,or a security vulnerability with the existing language is
        found. Changes to script are imperative for the growth of Bitcoin as a
        protocol and to allow the use-cases of Bitcoin to grow along with the
        needs of its users. This blog will be dedicated to exploring all kinds
        of Bitcoin topics but I thought I should start off explaining where the
        name comes from, which is the programmatic name of the script spending
        condition -- 'scriptpubkey'. For these beginning posts at the very least
        I will discuss script more extensively and plan to look at Bitcoin code
        snippets, historical and otherwise. Look forward to more posts in the
        future!
